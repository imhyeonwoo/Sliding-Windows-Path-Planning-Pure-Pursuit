# 🛣️ LaneFollower_WS

A **lane detection → path generation → Pure-Pursuit control** pipeline based on ROS Noetic.  
This repository contains the code and demo for the *3rd Autonomous Driving Software Competition(제3회 미래형자동차 자율주행 SW 경진대회)* during the 2024 summer vacation at Konkuk University.  
(Includes offline verification scripts using Matplotlib.)

## 🚀 Main Features

### ✅ Lane Detection (LaneDetector)
* Bird's-eye view transformation & HLS color masking  
* Removes circular objects (traffic lights, signs, flower markers)  
* Uses histogram + sliding window to detect left/right lane pixels  
* Publishes **left (1st-order) / right (3rd-order) poly-fit coefficients** on `/lane/*_fit` topics  
* Publishes BEV & debug images on `/car/*_image` topics  

### ✅ Path Generation (PathPlanner)
* Calculates the **vehicle center path function** `P(x)` based on the right lane  
* Computes target coordinates at look-ahead distance `x_la` (default 0.85 m)  
* Publishes `/path/lookahead_point`  
* For efficiency, sets `x_ld` instead of ld in the Pure-Pursuit node and uses `P'(x_ld)` during calculation  

### ✅ Pure-Pursuit Control (PurePursuitCtrl)
* Calculates steering angle based on the look-ahead point  
* Publishes throttle (fixed at 0.8 to observe lateral motion clearly)  
* Uses `/car/steering` and `/car/throttle` topics 

### ✅ Offline Matplotlib Demo
* `demo/lane_demo_offline.py`  
  * Reads a video → displays BEV, lane, path, and look-ahead point in a matplotlib figure in real-time  
  * Prints Pure-Pursuit steering angles to the console → **algorithm verification without ROS**

## 🧠 Core Algorithm – Calculate Steering Angle

The following describes the process of calculating the steering angle from the look-ahead point in Pure Pursuit.

![Steering Angle Formula](./docs/steering_formula.png)

- Accordingly, in sections with high curvature, y_la  decreases while x_la remains constant, resulting in a shorter look-ahead distance.
- This enables the successful implementation of a dynamic look-ahead distance that adjusts according to the curvature of the road.

## 🔀 Path Shifting – Path Shift

The target path is shifted based on the slope of the detected lane function and its normal vector to align with the vehicle's centerline.

## ⚙️ How to Use

### 🔧 Build (ROS Noetic)

```bash
cd ~/workspace/lane_follower_ws
catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
source devel/setup.bash
```
- catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release builds the project with optimization enabled for better runtime performance and reflects source code changes immediately.

### 🚀 Example Execution

```bash
# Full 3-node pipeline
roslaunch lane_follower lane_follower.launch

# Test individual nodes
rosrun lane_follower lane_detector.py           # Camera → Lane detection
rosrun lane_follower path_planner.py            # Lane → Path generation
rosrun lane_follower pure_pursuit_ctrl.py       # Path → Control

# Offline Matplotlib demo (requires video file)
python3 demo/lane_demo_offline.py --video trackrecord4_2x.mp4
```
